R&amp;D Project - Network Anomaly Detection using LSTM-Autoencoder
This paper directly addresses network intrusion detection, which is a core Computer Networks security problem. We're analyzing actual network traffic data (packets, flows, protocols) to detect malicious activities like DDoS attacks, port scanning, and botnet communications. The LSTM-Autoencoder processes network flow features such as packet sizes, inter-arrival times, protocol types, and port numbers - all fundamental CNET concepts. Our improvement will enhance real-time network monitoring systems that protect enterprise networks, which is critical for modern network infrastructure. We're essentially building an intelligent Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that sits at the network layer and analyzes traffic patterns to identify anomalies - this is pure applied Computer Networks with Data Science. The datasets we're using (InSDN, NSL-KDD) contain real network attack scenarios, and our goal is to improve detection accuracy while reducing false alarms in production network environments.
